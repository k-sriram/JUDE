function jude_check_bod
COMMON DATA_VARS, DATA_L1, DATA_L1A, DATA_L2

; Every observation has to start with a bright object detection
; The frame count increases monotonically at the beginning and
; then does odd things until the end of the BOD.
; If I do not find this pattern, I return 0, otherwise 1.
;Modifications:
; July 22, 2016: JM Modified frame count.
; July 31, 2016: JM Changed GTI to DQI
; May  23, 2017: JM: Version 3.1
; Nov. 21, 2017: JM Switched to common variable
;Note that there is an offset of 32768 in the frame count to keep it integer.

	dqi_value	 = 1; BOD value - anything odd implies BOD.
